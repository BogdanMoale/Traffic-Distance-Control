# Traffic-Distance-Control

# Project Description

This project focuses on modeling and simulating an autonomous vehicle system in MATLAB Simulink to maintain an optimal distance from vehicles ahead while adjusting its speed according to traffic conditions.

## Project Components

### 1. Vehicle Dynamics Model
The simulation model includes a detailed representation of the vehicle's dynamics, accounting for factors such as mass, inertia, tire characteristics, and suspension properties. Special emphasis is placed on modeling the vehicle's motion control capabilities, including acceleration and braking.

### 2. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) System
An Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system is implemented to regulate the vehicle's speed and maintain a safe distance from vehicles ahead. The ACC system continuously monitors the distance to the lead vehicle and adjusts the vehicle's speed accordingly, accelerating or decelerating as needed to avoid collisions and maintain a predefined following distance.


## Usage
To use the simulation model:
1. Open MATLAB and Simulink.
2. Load the provided Simulink model file `auto_distanta.mdl`.
3. Configure simulation parameters such as vehicle characteristics, and ACC system settings.
4. Run the simulation and analyze the vehicle's behavior, including speed adjustments and following distance maintenance
